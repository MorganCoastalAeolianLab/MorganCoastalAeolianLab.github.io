The JP Morgan Research Lab @ UWF focuses on the geomorphic processes of coastal and aeolian landscapes and the impact of humans on these environments. 

We integrate state-of-the-art field and laboratory research with computer models and remote sensing observations to study the relationships between waves, tides, wind, sediment, ecology, groundwater, and/or humans on coastal beach and dune systems. 

A variety of undergraduate and graduate research projects are supported by the lab, including studies on the morphologic evolution of beach and dunes systems, beach nourishment and dune restoration, ecological function of dune growth, relationship between sedimentology and nesting behavior (sea turtle & shore bird), anthropogenic modifications on sediment transport, and coastal management & resiliency planning.  


**The JP Morgan Lab is always interested in hearing from prospective graduate & undergraduate students!**

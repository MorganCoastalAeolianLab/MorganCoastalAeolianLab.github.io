Research conducted by the Morgan Lab is largely through field-based projects, including acquisition and analysis of coastal morphology, sediments, and other physical/environmental parameters. 

The lab is equipped with state-of-the-art topographic surveying equipment, including two high-accuracy (sub-centimeter) Emlid Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK GPS), two CST-Berger total stations, and multiple DJI Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We also have licenses for AgiSoft Metashape and Pix4D Mapper - Structure for Motion Software to construct orthomosaic and DEMs from UAV images.  

Wind and aeolian sediment transport data can be collected using a variety of 3-cup and sonic (3D & 2D) anemometers along with Wenglor particle counters and hose traps. 

Surface sediments can be analyzed using a Retsch sonic sieve shaker and a full range of U.S. standard 8" sieves. Other environmental monitoring equipment available includes temp & RH sensors, water level pressure transducers, current flow meters, soil moisture probes, and rain gauges. 

Through faculty collaborations, students working in the JP Morgan Lab also have access to a variety of additional field and laboratory instruments pertaining to soil, meteorological, and hydrological research.
